I started paying attention to Avalanche because of the expansion of DeFi Kingdoms over to Avalanche called Crystalvale.  
But then I found an opportunity on Avalanche I couldn’t ignore.

I believe the Avalanche ($AVAX) ecosystem will have an incredible 2022. Right now, I believe it’s one of the most underrated blockchains out there.

DeFi Kingdoms expanding over to Avalanche to become the first multi-chain game (on both the Harmony $ONE and Avalanche $AVAX blockchains) is a big reason for my bullishness.

In case you haven’t seen my other videos – I believe DeFi Kingdoms is literally one of the best opportunities in crypto today – and it’s only going to get better with its expansion over to Crystalvale on the Avalanche (AVAX) network this month.

A short note on DeFi Kingdoms btw –

Right now, my focus is on accumulating as much #JEWEL as possible so I can single-stake it in Crystalvale for #CRYSTAL when the expansion of DeFi Kingdoms over to Avalanche happens (I expect this February 15th give or take a few days)

To accumulate $JEWEL, my number one strategy is to stake JEWEL, AVAX, LUNA & MATIC in the liquidity pools Gardens to earn a 300-400% return (this is what people refer to as DeFi farming).

(note: I also own heroes)

But the yields you can get are likely to get a lot better – very soon.

When Serendale, the primary game in DeFi Kingdoms dropped, early investors got 15,000%+ returns for being early to provide liquidity in the liquidity pools (the Gardens).

When DeFi Kingdoms expands to the Avalanche network (AVAX) – it will make it the first game to be multichain.

When it does, the new Ice Gardens in Crystalvale – the expansion – will likely provide an incredible yield for early investors.

I am personally speculating 1,000%+ – but it could be higher (or lower, due your own diligence!)

The only way to obtain these yields is by holding $CRYSTAL, which you’ll be able to obtain by single staking JEWEL in the new bank.

But Avalanche has a lot to offer, and I believe we’ll see A LOT more games pop up on Avalanche (like Cadabra) because it’s fast and offers subnets.

Protocols have popped up to support the Avalanche network, including some pretty incredible investment opportunities.

That’s what I’m going to address in this video.

This is not intended to be financial advice – but just what I am doing.
